# ALLDEBRID Streaming Plugin
## for OSX /MAC 

There is a streaming plugin for Windows and Linux users on the Alldebrid site however no support for mac users

I set about understanding the working of the code with the aim of producing a working version for personal use which I now also make available to the community.

Credits to Andy Portmen and Alldebrid for the framework of code necessary to make this work.

Also credit to Letcode's youtube channel where I learnt the basic of Native Messaging
