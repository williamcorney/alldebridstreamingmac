# ALLDEBRID Streaming Plugin
## for OSX /MAC 

There is a streaming plugin for Windows and Linux users on the Alldebrid site however no support for mac users

I set about understanding the working of the code made available for windows/linux users, with the view to producing a working MAC version of the code.

Credits to Andy Portmen and Alldebrid for the framework of code necessary to make this work.

Also credit to Letcode's youtube channel where I learnt the basic of Native Messaging

In my case the install script creates a com.alld.node folder in root of user folders with the files host.js, messaging.js , node.js and run.sh

The original install script which i gleaned from the alldebrid site by changing windows.zip to mac.zip , seemed to be having problems creating the above folder and/copying the said files to it.
